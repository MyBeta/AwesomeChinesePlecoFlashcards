## :arrow_heading_down: How to import
### :iphone: Android
(source: [Pleco manual/Flashcards](http://android.pleco.com/manual/310/flash.html))
* open the requested file on Github
* download the "Raw" file (right click on "Raw" > Download target)
* in Pleco go to Flashcards "Import/Export" > Import Cards
* Choose the file you just downloaded 
* Mandatroy settings: Encoding: UTF-8. 
* I also pick the following settings (but you can choose otherwise): 
  * Definition source: Prefer File (I don't want the definition of Pleco)
  * Fill in missing fields: yes (to add traditional characters or Pinyin if missing)
  * Ambiguous entries: Promt (ask me what to do if the import dosn't know which entry it matches)
  * Duplicate entries: Update + merge (update with new definition and don't use the old anymore)
* Then click on begin import

### :phone: iPhone
(source: [Pleco manual/Flashcards](http://iphone.pleco.com/manual/30200/flashtut.html))
* I think iPhones can not download files, so you can't do it on your phone... 
* Use another device, e.g. your computer to download the "Raw" file, then you can for example send it to your phone via email. 
* Save the email attachement, then the rest is similar to Android... good luck!
